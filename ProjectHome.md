This project aims to reimplement on top of OpenGL ES 2.0 the most common / useful game orientated functionality removed from OpenGL 2.0. Such things include but are not limited to:
  * Matrix Tranformations
  * Multi-Texturing
  * Begin / End Paradigm
  * Default Fixed Function Interface and Shader
  * GLU helper functions
  * Alpha Test
  * Texture Coordinate Generators
  * Texture Formats GL\_BGR, etc

It will be as portable as possible, but will likely be optimised for the Open Pandora OMAP3 based handheld console. Conformance is not a priority, performance is more important.
